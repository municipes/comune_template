This is a composer based installer for the [Comune Silfi](https://www.drupal.org/project/comune_silfi).

# Prerequisites

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

It's just composer, isn't it awesome? :)

## Installation of Comune Silfi

```
composer create-project municipes/comune_template:1.x DIRECTORY --no-interaction
```

Composer will create a new directory called DIRECTORY.
The installed folders will contain all Drupal related files in the `web`
directory and any third-party dependencies in the composer `vendor` directory.
Drupal core will be installed to `web/core`. Inside you will find the
html directory with the entire code base of the [Comune Silfi distribution](https://www.drupal.org/project/comune_silfi).
Install your Comune Silfi site like any other Drupal website using the `install.php` script or `drush`.
